You are a senior full-stack engineer and product architect helping me build an MVP for a platform called SafiLocate – Smart Lost & Found Platform.

I will attach a Functional Specification Document (FSD) for SafiLocate.
Your first job is to carefully read and understand the FSD before doing anything else.

1. Understand the Product

Read the attached FSD for SafiLocate end-to-end.

Then, in your own words, give me a short product summary covering:

Main problem SafiLocate solves

Target users (in Rwanda context)

Core MVP user flows (lost item posting, found item posting, search, claim, payments, admin)

Extract from the FSD:

Explicit constraints (low budget, hosting limits, simplicity, etc.)

Core non-functional requirements (performance, security, scalability)

Keep this summary concise but clear.

2. Choose and Justify the Tech Stack

Using the requirements in the FSD and the fact that we are on Replit with a very low budget, propose a realistic tech stack:

Frontend: (e.g., Next.js, React, or another framework you recommend for Replit)

Backend: (e.g., Node.js + Express, Next.js API routes, or FastAPI, etc.)

Database: (e.g., Replit DB, PostgreSQL on a free/low-cost provider)

AI usage: how we’ll integrate LLMs minimally to keep costs low (e.g., tag generation, category normalization only)

Payments: Flutterwave (or another realistic option) for:

Paid lost item listings

Optional tipping

For each choice, briefly explain why it fits SafiLocate’s MVP and the Rwanda/low-budget context.

3. Design the System Architecture

Based on the FSD, propose a high-level architecture:

Describe the main components:

Frontend app

Backend/API

Database

Payment integration

AI integration

Admin dashboard

Draw a text-based architecture diagram (ASCII), showing how these components interact:

User flows for:

Posting a found item (free)

Posting a lost item (paid)

Searching & filtering

Claiming an item

Admin review/approval

Highlight where AI is used and how to keep it cheap and simple in the MVP.

4. Propose the Repository Structure

Suggest a clean repo structure that fits Replit and the selected stack.

Example (adapt to your chosen stack):

/frontend or /app

/api or /server

/db (schema, migrations, seed data)

/lib (shared utilities)

/config (env, payment config, AI config)

/tests

For each top-level folder, give a one-line description of what goes inside.

5. Convert the FSD into a Development Plan

Now I want you to turn the FSD into a concrete, actionable development plan suitable for Vibe Coding workflows (AI-assisted coding) on Replit.

Break it into phases and tasks:

Phase 1 – Project Setup & Infrastructure

Initialize repo and basic tooling (lint, prettier, env handling)

Set up base frontend shell (layout, theme, global styles)

Set up backend/API boilerplate

Connect to database

Prepare environment variables for payments & AI (no real secrets in code)

Phase 2 – Core User Features

Found item posting (free) flow

Lost item posting (paid) flow

Search & results pages

Claim flow

Phase 3 – Admin & Moderation

Admin login (simple password for MVP)

Admin listing management (approve/block)

Basic analytics (items by category, lost vs found)

Phase 4 – AI & Matching Enhancements (MVP level)

Tag generation service (single cheap LLM call per item)

Tags stored in DB

Search endpoint updated to use tags + text matching

Phase 5 – Payments & Final Polishing

Integrate payment provider (e.g., Flutterwave) for:

Lost item posting fee

Optional tipping endpoint (stub or real)

Handle callbacks & update DB

Error handling, UX improvements

Deployment checklist for Replit / external DB

For each phase, list:

The goal of the phase

A numbered list of tasks

Which tasks are must-have for MVP vs optional “nice-to-have”

6. Output Format

Return your answer in a clear structured markdown format:

Product Summary

Tech Stack Proposal

System Architecture Overview

Repo Structure

Phased Development Plan with Tasks

The output should be detailed enough that I can then ask you, in follow-up steps, to start implementing these tasks one by one with AI-assisted coding inside Replit.

Do not start writing any actual code yet.
In this response, focus only on planning and structuring the development of SafiLocate based strictly on the attached FSD.
