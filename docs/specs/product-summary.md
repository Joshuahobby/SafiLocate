## Main Problem
In Rwanda, recovering lost items (IDs, phones, documents) is inefficient, relying on fragmented word-of-mouth, radio announcements, or informal social media posts. There is no centralized, trusted digital registry.

## Target Users
*   **Everyday Citizens:** People who lose or find personal items.
*   **"Super Finders":** Moto drivers, taxi operators, cleaners, and security guards who frequently find items.
*   **Venues/Institutions:** Banks, bars, and transport cooperatives managing lost property.

## Core MVP User Flows
*   **Report Found Item (Free):** A frictionless, barrier-free form for finders to list items (ID, phone, etc.) to encourage reporting.
*   **Report Lost Item (Paid):** A paid listing flow for seekers to post detailed inquiries, serving as the primary revenue model.
*   **Search & Match:** A mobile-optimized search with filters (category, location) to connect seekers with reported items.
*   **Claiming:** A secure process for a seeker to verify ownership and contact the finder.
*   **Admin:** Back-office tools to moderate content and manage the platform.

## Key Constraints & Requirements
*   **Constraint:** Extremely low operating costs (Rwanda context) and simple compliance.
*   **Constraint:** Mobile-first design (primary access point for users).
*   **Performance:** Pages must load <1.5s on 3G networks.
*   **Scalability:** Stateless architecture for easy scaling.
